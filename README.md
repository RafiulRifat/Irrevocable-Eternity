🧭 Overview
Mystic Reign is a thrilling 2D hack-and-slash roleplaying adventure.

Your mission is to guide Natan through two action-packed levels and restore peace.

⚔️ Level 1: Defeat all enemies and reach the ancient dragon to progress.

🪙 Level 2: Ride the dragon and collect floating coins while dodging lethal spikes.

Each level introduces unique mechanics, visual themes, and increasing challenges.
